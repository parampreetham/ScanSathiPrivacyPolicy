  <h1><center>Privacy Policy for Scan Sathi</center></h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> June 7, 2025</p>

  <p>Scan Sathi is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your data when you use our mobile application.</p>

  <h2>1. Overview</h2>
  <p>Scan Sathi is a document scanning app designed for shop owners and individuals who need to scan, crop, enhance, and align documents such as Aadhaar, Voter ID, PAN, and other cards. Your data privacy is our top priority.</p>

  <h2>2. Data Collection</h2>
  <p>We do not collect or store any personal data such as your name, phone number, or address.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>No login or account creation required</strong></li>
    <li><strong>No analytics or behavior tracking</strong></li>
    <li><strong>No cloud storage or external uploads of your documents</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Image and Document Handling</h2>
  <p>All image processing is done <strong>locally on your device</strong> using Google’s ML Kit. Your images never leave your phone unless you explicitly share them.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Images are processed temporarily in cache memory</li>
    <li>They are deleted after processing unless saved or shared by the user</li>
    <li>We do not retain images or access them after the app is closed</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Permissions and Image Access</h2>
  <p>Scan Sathi requests the following permissions solely for its core functionality:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Camera: To scan documents using your phone’s camera</li>
    <li>Media/Storage: To save scanned documents locally to your phone</li>
    <li>Internet: Only used for downloading updates or enabling optional premium upgrade features (not for tracking)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Free Trial and In-App Purchases</h2>
  <p>Scan Sathi offers a <strong>7-day free trial</strong> with full feature access. After the trial ends, users may choose to upgrade to the premium version via a one-time in-app purchase.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>We use Google Play Billing for secure and encrypted payments</li>
    <li>No personal data like email or name is required or collected</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Storage and Sharing</h2>
  <p>When you save a processed image, it is saved to your device’s local storage. When you share an image, it uses the system’s secure and default sharing options (e.g., WhatsApp, email, etc.).</p>

  <h2>7. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>We use the following trusted third-party tools:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Google ML Kit:</strong> For offline, on-device document detection and enhancement</li>
    <li><strong>Google Play Billing:</strong> For secure in-app payments and subscription management</li>
    <li><strong>Firebase Firestore:</strong> Used to store trial metadata (device ID, trial start timestamp, and premium status only)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>No personally identifiable information (PII) is sent to any server.</p>

  <h2>8. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>Scan Sathi is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under this age.</p>

  <h2>9. Data Security</h2>
  <p>Your data stays on your device. We do not collect, store, or transmit your personal documents unless you choose to share them. We follow best practices to ensure temporary data is removed after use.</p>

  <h2>10. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this policy as needed to reflect app changes. Any updates will be posted in-app or on this page with a new effective date.</p>
