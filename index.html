  <h1><center>Privacy Policy for Scan Sathi</center></h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> June 7, 2025</p>

  <p>Scan Sathi is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your data when you use our mobile application.</p>

  <h2>1. Overview</h2>
  <p>Scan Sathi is a document scanning app designed for shop owners and individuals who need to scan, crop, enhance, and align documents such as Aadhaar, Voter ID, PAN, and other cards. Your data privacy is our top priority.</p>

  <h2>2. Data Collection</h2>
  <p>We do not collect or store any personal data. You do not need to create an account or provide any personal information to use the app.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>No login or account creation required</strong></li>
    <li><strong>No analytics or behavior tracking</strong></li>
    <li><strong>No cloud storage or uploads</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Image and Document Handling</h2>
  <p>All image processing is done <strong>locally on your device</strong> using Google's ML Kit. We never upload or transmit your images or documents to any server.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Images are temporarily cached only for processing</li>
    <li>Images are deleted automatically after session unless you choose to save or share</li>
    <li>We never store images permanently without your explicit action</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Permissions and Image Access</h2>
  <p>Scan Sathi requires the following permissions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Camera: To scan documents using your phone's camera.</li>
    <li>Storage/Media Access: To save the scanned documents to your device.</li>
    <li>Internet (optional): Only used when sharing documents or downloading updates. No user data is sent online.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We respect your privacy and handle these images only during your usage session.</p>

  <h2>5. Storage and Sharing</h2>
  <p>If you choose to save a processed image, it is saved to your device's local storage or gallery. If you choose to share it, it is shared using your device’s standard sharing interface (e.g., WhatsApp, email, etc.).</p>

  <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>We use Google’s ML Kit to power our on-device image processing. No user data is sent to external servers, and ML Kit functions entirely offline for our use case.</p>

  <h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>Scan Sathi does not target or knowingly collect personal data from children under 13 years of age.</p>

  <h2>8. Data Security</h2>
  <p>Your images are processed locally and never uploaded. We ensure the app does not store data longer than necessary and gives users full control of when and how their documents are saved or shared.</p>

  <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this policy as needed. If any changes occur, they will be reflected in the app and this page. We recommend you check this page periodically for updates.</p>
